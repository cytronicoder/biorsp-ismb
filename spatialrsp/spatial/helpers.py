    """
    Compute the Radar Scanning Radius (RSR) for a set of angles within
    a sliding window.

    The RSR is computed as the square root of the area under the histogram
    of angles within a sliding window centered at a specified angle. The area
    is computed as the sum of the bin heights multiplied by their widths.

    Modes:
        - "absolute": after computing raw area A_fg, scale it by coverage
                    (N_fg/N_bg) so that sparser fg leads to smaller radius.
        - "relative": leave the raw histogram area alone.

    Args:
        angles: The angles to compute the RSR for, in radians.
        center: The center angle in radians.
        window: The width of the sliding window in radians.
        bins: The bin edges for the histogram.
        coverage: The coverage ratio (N_fg / N_bg) for scaling in absolute mode.
        mode: Either absolute or relative.

    Returns:
        The computed RSR value, which is the square root of the area under the histogram
        of the angles within the specified window, scaled by coverage if in absolute mode.
